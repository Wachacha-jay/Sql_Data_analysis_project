# The Analysis
Every query in this project was designed to explore specific facets of the data analyst job market. Here's my approach to addressing each question:

1. Which data analyst roles offer the highest salaries?

To identify the top-paying data analyst roles, I extracted job postings with the highest salaries and matched them to company names using a left join on the company ID from the company dimension table. After removing null salary values, I filtered the results specifically for data analyst roles.

``` SQL
SELECT
	jpf.job_id,
	jpf.company_id,
	jpf.job_title,
	jpf.salary_year_avg,
	jpf.job_location,
	cd.name
FROM
	job_postings_fact jpf
JOIN company_dim cd 
	on
	jpf.company_id = cd.company_id
WHERE
	jpf.salary_year_avg is not null
	AND jpf.job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
	AND jpf.job_location = 'Anywhere'
ORDER BY
	jpf.salary_year_avg desc
LIMIT
	10;

```
